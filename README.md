# Bandit SAST Demo for Python Applications

This repository accompanies the article **“Applying Bandit SAST Tool to a Python Application”**, showing how to use the **Bandit** tool to perform static application security testing (SAST) on Python projects.

---

## 📖 Description

Static Application Security Testing (SAST) analyzes source code to identify weaknesses that could lead to vulnerabilities, such as command injections or insecure credential handling. Unlike dynamic testing, SAST inspects the software “from the inside” before it runs, providing early feedback and promoting secure coding practices.

**Bandit** is a tool that detects common security issues in Python projects by analyzing the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and running various detection plugins.
